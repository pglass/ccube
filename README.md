Overview
--------

This is a Rubik's cube solver, ported from my Python version at https://github.com/pglass/cube.

It follows a fixed, layer-by-layer algorithm which does not optimize for moves or speed.

WARNING: This manages memory in an ad-hoc way. You should assume it contains issues/vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, memory leaks, and so on.
